### Files
---
Select **File > New** from the Codio menu and create a file with a `.pencilcode` suffix. You will notice this file in your **FileTree.**

### Page Layout
---
Each page in the guide can have its own layout. You can select how many panels you want, and what information goes in each panel. Click the wrench in the top-right corner of your guide. You can select the layout from here. 

When setting up PencilCode, click the settings wrench icon and select **2 Panels without a tree.** Navigate to **Open Tabs** and drag the `.pencilcode` file under **Add Tab.** Position the `.pencilcode` file in panel 0. The guide will be in panel 1.
